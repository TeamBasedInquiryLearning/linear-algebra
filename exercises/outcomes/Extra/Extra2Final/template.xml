Explain why the set <m>S={{columns}}</m> does or does not span <m>\mathbb R^4</m>
by discussing a relevant vector equation.

The vector equation <m>\cdots=\vec w</m>
{{#surj}}always has solutions{{/surj}}{{^surj}}may cause a contradiction{{/surj}},
so the set {{#surj}}spans{{/surj}}{{^surj}}does not span{{/surj}}.

Explain why the set <m>S={{columns}}</m> is linearly independent or dependent
by discussing a relevant vector equation.

        <outtro>
            <p>
The vector equation <m>\cdots=\vec 0</m>
has infinitely-many solutions
so the set is linearly dependent.

Explain why the set <m>S={{columns}}</m> is or is not a basis for <m>\mathbb R^4</m>
by discussing spanning and independence.
            </p>
        </content>
        <outtro>
            <p>
The set is not a basis because it is not independent.
{{^surj}}It's also not a basis because it does not span <m>\mathbb R^4</m>.{{/surj}}

Explain why the collection <m>{{polys}}</m> of polynomials is linearly independent
or linearly dependent by discussing two isomorphic vector spaces.
            </p>
        </content>
        <outtro>
            <p>
The vector space <m>\mathcal P^3</m> is isomorphic to <m>\mathbb R^4</m>.
So the collection is linearly dependent because the isomorphic set of vectors
studied earlier is linearly dependent.
