<p>Suppose you are building a starship, which is for some reason in the shape of a cube. Due to some clever engineering, each part of the ship can be made out of a finite set of components. In fact, there are only 5 basic components. Assemble them in different ways, and you make every part of the cube! However, at the last minute, the design is changed from a cube to an octahedron. Would it make more sense to take all of the parts you were planning to build, build them anyway and modify them later, or to just modify the 5 basic components?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="VS6.html#observation-11" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
