<li><div class="para">Start by assuming you have a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> How many basis vectors should you have?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For each basis vector in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> define a function that returns 1 if it's given that basis vector, and returns 0 if it's given any other basis vector. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(\vec{b_i}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{b_j}\)</span> are each members of the basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> and you'll need a function <span class="process-math">\(f_i:V \rightarrow \{0,1\}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f_i(b_i) = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_i(b_j)= 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(j \neq i\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">How many of these functions will you need? Show that each of them is in <span class="process-math">\(V^*\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">Show that the functions you found in the last part are a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V^*\text{?}\)</span> To do this, take an arbitrary function <span class="process-math">\(h \in V^*\)</span> and some vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v} \in V\text{.}\)</span> Write <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> in terms of the basis you chose earlier. How can you write <span class="process-math">\(h(\vec{v})\text{,}\)</span> with respect to that basis? Pay attention to the fact that all functions in <span class="process-math">\(V^*\)</span> are linear.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now that you've got a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V^*\text{,}\)</span> can you find an isomorphism?</div></li>
