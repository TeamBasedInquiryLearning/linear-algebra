Class Activities    Two systems of linear equations (and their corresponding augmented matrices) are said to be equivalent equivalent matrices if they have the same solution set.  For example, both of these systems share the same solution set .          Therefore these augmented matrices are equivalent (even though they're not equal ), which we denote with :         Following are seven procedures used to manipulate an augmented matrix. Label the procedures that would result in an equivalent augmented matrix as valid , and label the procedures that might change the solution set of the corresponding linear system as invalid .   Swap two rows.  Swap two columns.  Add a constant to every term in a row.  Multiply a row by a nonzero constant.  Add a constant multiple of one row to another row.  Replace a column with zeros.  Replace a row with zeros.        The following three row operations row operations produce equivalent augmented matrices.   Swap two rows, for example, :     Multiply a row by a nonzero constant, for example, :    Add a constant multiple of one row to another row, for example, :         Consider the following (equivalent) linear systems.

We can rewrite the previous in terms of equivalences of augmented matrices   Determine the row operation(s) necessary in each step to transform the most complicated system's augmented matrix into the simplest.      A matrix is in reduced row echelon form ( RREF ) Reduced row echelon form if   The leading term (first nonzero term) of each nonzero row is a 1. Call these terms pivots . pivot   Each pivot is to the right of every higher pivot.  Each term above or below a pivot is zero.  All rows of zeroes are at the bottom of the matrix.   Every matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form. If is a matrix, we write for the reduced row echelon form of that matrix.      Recall that a matrix is in reduced row echelon form ( RREF ) if   The leading term (first nonzero term) of each nonzero row is a 1. Call these terms pivots .  Each pivot is to the right of every higher pivot.  Each term above or below a pivot is zero.  All rows of zeroes are at the bottom of the matrix.   For each matrix, circle the leading terms, and label it as RREF or not RREF. For the ones not in RREF, find their RREF.

In practice, if we simply need to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form, we use technology to do so.  However, it is also important to understand the Gauss-Jordan elimination Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm that a computer or calculator uses to convert a matrix (augmented or not) into reduced row echelon form.

Write an arbitrary system of linear equations in variables. Your notation should be unambiguous.  Label an element of your solution set. You won't know what it is exactly, so you'll have to use a variable. Remember what it means (by definition!) to be in the solution set.

A linear transformation with identical codomain and image, which is therefore surjective; and a linear transformation with an image smaller than the codomain , which is therefore not surjective.

The easiest way to determine if the linear map with standard matrix is surjective is to see if has a pivot in each row.      What can you conclude about the linear map with standard matrix ?   Its standard matrix has more columns than rows, so is not injective.  Its standard matrix has more columns than rows, so is injective.

Basically, a linear transformation cannot reduce dimension without collapsing vectors into each other, and a linear transformation cannot increase dimension from its domain to its image.      A linear transformation whose domain has a larger dimension than its codomain, and is therefore not injective; and a linear transformation whose domain has a smaller dimension than its codomain, and is therefore not surjective.

The vectors , , and   For example, represents the shaded area shown below.      Parallelogram generated by and   Similarly, represents the shaded area shown below.      Parallelogram generated by and     The paralellograms generated by the standard matrices , and are illustrated below.      Parallelogram generated by and   Describe the value of .            Cannot be determined from this information.       The determinant is the unique function satisfying these properties:   whenever two columns of the matrix are identical.   , assuming no other columns change.   , assuming no other columns change.    Note that these last two properties together can be phrased as The determinant is linear in each column.       The determinant must also satisfy other properties. Consider and .      Parallelogram built by and   The base of both parallelograms is , while the height has not changed, so the determinant does not change either. This can also be proven using the other properties of the determinant:       Swapping columns may be thought of as a reflection, which is represented by a negative determinant. For example, the following matrices transform the unit square into the same parallelogram, but the second matrix reflects its orientation.       Reflection of a parallelogram as a result of swapping columns.       The fact that swapping columns multiplies determinants by a negative may be verified by adding and subtracting columns.       To summarize, we've shown that the column versions of the three row-reducing operations a matrix may be used to simplify a determinant in the following way:   Multiplying a column by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar:   Swapping two columns changes the sign of the determinant:   Adding a multiple of a column to another column does not change the determinant:        The transformation given by the standard matrix scales areas by , and the transformation given by the standard matrix scales areas by . By what factor does the transformation given by the standard matrix scale areas?      Area changing under the composition of two linear maps             Cannot be determined       Since the transformation given by the standard matrix is obtained by applying the transformations given by and , it follows that .      Recall that row operations may be produced by matrix multiplication.   Multiply the first row of by :   Swap the first and second row of :   Add times the third row to the first row of :        The determinants of row operation matrices may be computed by manipulating columns to reduce each matrix to the identity:   Scaling a row:   Swapping rows:   Adding a row multiple to another row:        Consider the row operation applied as follows to show :    Find a matrix such that , by applying the same row operation to .

We see that this vector equation has solution set , so is a linear combination; for example,     is a linear combination of the vectors exactly when the vector equation has a solution. To solve this vector equation, we compute . This vector equation has no solution, so is not a linear combination.

Explain how to determine which of these statements is true.      The set of vectors spans exactly when the vector equation has a solution for all  . If there is some vector for which this vector equation has no solution, then the set does not span . To answer this, we compute . We see that for some , this vector equation will not have a solution, so the set of vectors does not span .    EV3   Consider the following two sets of Euclidean vectors. Explain why one of these sets is a subspace of , and why the other is not.    To show that is a subspace, let and , so we know that and .  Consider To see if , we need to check if . We compute Thus , so is closed under vector addition.  Now consider Similarly, to check that , we need to check if , so we compute and we see that , so is closed under scalar multiplication. Therefore is a subspace of .  Now, to show is not a subspace, we will show that it is not closed under vector addition.    (Solution Method 1) Now let and , so we know that and .  Consider To see if , we need to check if . We compute and thus \\textbf{only when} . Since this is not true in general, is not closed under vector addition, and thus cannot be a subspace.    (Solution Method 2) Note that the vector belongs to since . However, the vector does not belong to since . Therefore is not closed under scalar multiplication, and thus is not a subspace.

The set of vectors is linearly dependent .      Explain how to determine which of these statements is true.      The set of vectors is linearly independent exactly when the vector equation has no non-trivial (i.e. nonzero) solutions. The set is linearly dependent when there exists a nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) solution. We compute .  Thus, this vector equation has a solution set . Since there are nontrivial solutions, we conclude that the set of vectors is linearly dependent .    EV5     Write a statement involving spanning and independence properties that's equivalent to each claim below.    The set of vectors is a basis of .    The set of vectors is not a basis of .      Explain how to determine which of these statements is true.      The set of vectors is a basis of exactly when it is linearly independent and the set spans . If it is either linearly dependent, or the set does not span , then the set is not a basis.  To answer this, we compute .

EV7   Consider the homogeneous system of equations     Find the solution space of the system.    Find a basis of the solution space.        Observe that   Letting and (since those correspond to the non-pivot columns), this is equivalent to the system Thus, the solution set is     Since we can write a basis for the solution space is       AT1   Consider the following maps of polynomials and defined by Explain why one of these maps is a linear transformation, and why the other map is not.    To show is a linear transformation, we must show two things:    To show respects addition, we compute But note that and , so we have .  For the second part, we compute But note that as well, so we have . Now, since respects both addition and scalar multiplication, we can conclude is a linear transformation.    (Solution method 1) As for , we compute However, note that , which is not always the same polynomial (for example, when ). So we see that , so does not respect addition and is therefore not a linear transformation.    (Solution method 2) As for , we may choose the polynomial and scalar . Then   But on the other hand, Since this isn't the same polynomial, does not preserve multiplication and is therefore not a linear transformation.

To find the image we compute      The kernel is the solution set of the corresponding homogeneous system of equations, i.e. So we compute Then, letting and we have     Since , we simply need to find a linearly independent subset of these four spanning vectors. So we compute Since the first two columns are pivot columns, they form a linearly independent spanning set, so a basis for is   To find a basis for the kernel, note that so a basis for the kernel is     The dimension of the image (the rank) is , the dimension of the kernel (the nullity) is , and the dimension of the domain of is , so we see , which verifies that the sum of the rank and nullity of is the dimension of the domain of .      AT4   Let be the linear transformation given by the standard matrix .    Explain why is or is not injective.    Explain why is or is not surjective.      Compute     Note that the third and fourth columns are non-pivot columns, which means contains infinitely many vectors, so is not injective.    Since there are only two pivots, the image (i.e. the span of the columns) is a 2-dimensional subspace (and thus does not equal ), so is not surjective.      VS1   Let be the set of all pairs of numbers of real numbers together with the following operations:     Show that scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition:     Explain why nonetheless is not a vector space.        We compute both sides:   and   Since these are the same, we have shown that the property holds.    To show is not a vector space, we must show that it fails one of the 8 defining properties of vector spaces. We will show that scalar multiplication does not distribute over scalar addition, i.e., there are values such that     (Solution method 1) First, we compute   Then we compute   Since when , the property fails to hold.    (Solution method 2) When we let , we may simplify both sides as follows.    Since these ordered pairs are different, the property fails to hold.        VS2     Given the set write a statement involving the solutions to a polynomial equation that's equivalent to each claim below.    The set of polynomials is linearly independent .    The set of polynomials is linearly dependent .      Explain how to determine which of these statements is true.      The set of polynomials is linearly independent exactly when the polynomial equation has no nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) solutions. The set is linearly dependent when this equation has a nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) solution.  To solve this equation, we distribute and then collect coefficients to obtain . These polynomials are equal precisely when their coefficients are equal, leading to the system .  To solve this, we compute   The system has (infintely many) nontrivial solutions, so we that the set of polynomials is linearly dependent .    MX1   Of the following three matrices, only two may be multiplied.   Explain which two may be multiplied and why. Then show how to find their product.     is the only one that can be computed, since corresponds to a linear transformation and corresponds to a linear transfromation . Thus the composition corresponds to a linear transformation with a standard matrix. We compute  . Thus     MX2   Let be a matrix.    Give a matrix that may be used to perform the row operation .    Give a matrix that may be used to perform the row operation .    Use matrix multiplication to describe the matrix obtained by applying and then to (note the order).                         MX3   Explain why each of the following matrices is or is not invertible by disussing its corresponding linear transformation. If the matrix is invertible, explain how to find its inverse.     We compute . We see is bijective, and therefore invertible. To compute the inverse, we solve by computing . Similarly, we solve by computing . Similarly, we solve by computing . Similarly, we solve by computing . Combining these, we obtain .  We compute . We see is not bijective and thus is not invertible.     GT1   Let be a matrix with determinant .

Let be the matrix obtained from by applying the row operation . What is ?        Adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant, so .

GT2   Show how to compute the determinant of the matrix     Here is one possible solution, first applying a single row operation, and then performing Laplace\/cofactor expansions to reduce the determinant to a linear combination of determinants:   Here is another possible solution, using row and column operations to first reduce the determinant to a matrix and then applying a formula:     GT3   Explain how to find the eigenvalues of the matrix .
