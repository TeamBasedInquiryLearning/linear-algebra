<p>For each of the following, decide if it's true or false. If you think it's true, can we construct a proof? If you think it's false, can we find a counterexample?</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If the coefficient matrix of a system of linear equations has a pivot in the rightmost column, then the system is inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>If a system of equations has two equations and four unknowns, then it must be consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>If a system of equations having four equations and three unknowns is consistent, then the solution is unique.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that a linear system has four equations and four unknowns and that the coefficient matrix has four pivots. Then the linear system is consistent and has a unique solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that a linear system has five equations and three unknowns and that the coefficient matrix has a pivot in every column. Then the linear system is consistent and has a unique solution.</p></li>
