<fact>

        <p>
  Every vector space with finite dimension, that is, every
  vector space <m>V</m> with a basis of the form
  <m>\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\dots,\vec v_n\}</m> is said to be
  <term>isomorphic</term> to a Euclidean space <m>\IR^n</m>, since there exists
  a natural correspondance between vectors in <m>V</m> and vectors in <m>\IR^n</m>:
        </p>
  <me>
    c_1\vec v_1+c_2\vec v_2+\dots+c_n\vec v_n
    \leftrightarrow
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
      c_1\\c_2\\\vdots\\c_n
    \end{array}\right]
  </me>

        <p>
  We've already been taking advantage of the previous fact by converting
  polynomials and matrices into Euclidean vectors. Since <m>\P^3</m>
  and <m>M_{2,2}</m> are both four-dimensional:
        </p>
  <me>
    4x^3+0x^2-1x+5
    \leftrightarrow
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
      4\\0\\-1\\5
    \end{array}\right]
    \leftrightarrow
    \left[\begin{array}{cc}
      4&amp;0\\-1&amp;5
    \end{array}\right]
  </me>

Suppose <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\P^8</m>, and you know that
 <m>W</m> is spanned by the six vectors <me>\{ x^4-x,x^3+x,x^3+x+1,x^4+2x,x^3,2x+1\}.</me>

<observation>
    <statement>
        <p>
  The space of polynomials <m>\P</m> (of <em>any</em> degree)
  has the basis <m>\{1,x,x^2,x^3,\dots\}</m>,
  so it is a natural example of an infinite-dimensional vector space.
        </p>
        <p>
  Since <m>\P</m> and other infinite-dimensional spaces cannot be treated as
  an isomorphic finite-dimensional Euclidean space <m>\IR^n</m>, vectors in
  such spaces cannot be studied by converting them into Euclidean vectors.
  Fortunately, most of the examples we will be
  interested in for this course will be finite-dimensional.
